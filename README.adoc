= Infinispan Spring Boot Starter

== Getting Started
Once you add `infinispan-spring-boot-starter` as a dependency to your project, a bean of type `EmbeddedCacheManager` can
be `autowired` into your java configuration classes. You can further customizer the cache manager by creating beans of
types `InfinispanCacheConfigurer`, and/or `InfinispanGlobalConfigurer`.

=== Example Project
Please take a look at the `infinispan-sample-app`.
